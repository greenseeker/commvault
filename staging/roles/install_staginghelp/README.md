# install_staginghelp role

This role copies the staginghelp script to /usr/local/bin and creates /etc/profile.d/staginghelpreminder.sh which prints a reminder that the `staginghelp` command is available when users log in.

The `staginghelp` script provides a command quick reference for users and a link to Connect for more info.
